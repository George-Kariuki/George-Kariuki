# 👋 Hey, I'm George Kariuki

I love turning ideas into real products. I build, I ship, and I iterate fast — whether it’s mobile apps, automation workflows, or backend systems. My mission is simple: **solve real problems with software and ship solutions that actually get used.**

---

## 🚀 What I Build
- **Mobile & Web Apps** using Flutter and Low-Code platforms (Bubble, Flutterflow, Adalo)  
- **APIs & Automations** using Python, n8n, and external services  
- **Product MVPs** that go from idea → prototype → launch, fast

I believe in **shipping over perfection**, rapid iteration, and building software that makes everyday systems more efficient — especially in emerging markets.

---

## 🎯 Where I’m Going (The Journey)
I’m leveling up into a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** — mastering:

- **Backend Development** (Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL)
- **DevOps Foundations** (Docker, CI/CD, Deployments)
- **Scalable System Design** (microservices, APIs, automation)

I come from a **Mechatronics Engineering + PLC Automation** background, so I naturally think in **systems, logic, and efficiency**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Current Tools I Build With**
`Flutter` • `Bubble` • `Flutterflow` • `Adalo` • `n8n` • `Supabase` • `Firebase`

**Engineering & Backend (In Progress)**
`Python` • `FastAPI` • `PostgreSQL` • `Docker` • `CI/CD` • `MQTT` • `Linux`

**Foundations**
`Git` • `REST APIs` • `PLC Automation` • `CAD (SolidWorks)` • `Systems Thinking`

## 📌 My Public Roadmap (2025)

**✅ Phase 1 — Apps & Automation (Now)**
- Ship well-documented mobile apps (Flutter + low/no-code builds)
- Automations using n8n & APIs
- Clean README documentation for every project

**🔄 Phase 2 — Backend Engineering (Next)**
- Build 3–5 Python/FastAPI APIs (auth, CRUD, microservices)
- Deploy using Render/Railway
- Add PostgreSQL and real data flows

**📌 Phase 3 — DevOps & Scaling (Later)**
- Dockerize my services
- Add CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Experiment with cloud deployments

## 📚 Learning in Public
I document what I learn, what I ship, and what I break.  
Because **consistency beats intensity**, and progress compounds.

---

## 📌 Motto
**Build fast. Ship often. Improve always.**

### 🚀 Let’s Build.
